# Module 10 Challenge
### Before You Begin
* Create a new repository for this project called `sqlalchemy-challenge`. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

* Clone the new repository to your computer.

* Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this Challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenge, such as `SurfsUp`.

* Add your Jupyter notebook and `app.py` to this folder. They’ll contain the main scripts to run for analysis. Also add the `Resources` folder, which contains the data files you will be using for this challenge.

* Push the changes to GitHub or GitLab.




### Instructions
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

### Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. To do so, complete the following steps:

* Note that you’ll use the provided files (`climate_starter.ipynb` and `hawaii.sqlite`) to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.

* Use the SQLAlchemy `create_engine()` function to connect to your SQLite database.

* Use the SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named `station` and `measurement`.

* Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.



* Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis by completing the steps in the following two subsections.

### Precipitation Analysis
* Find the most recent date in the dataset.

* Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.


* Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame, and set the index to the "date" column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by "date".

* Plot the results by using the DataFrame `plot` method, as the following image shows:


* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis
* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.

* Design a query to find the most-active stations (that is, the stations that have the most rows). To do so, complete the following steps:

  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.


  * Answer the following question: which station id has the greatest number of observations?
* Design a query that calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperatures that filters on the most-active station id found in the previous query.


* Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data. To do so, complete the following steps:

  * Filter by the station that has the greatest number of observations.

  * Query the previous 12 months of TOBS data for that station.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`, as the following image shows:


* Close your session.

### Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed. To do so, use Flask to create your routes as follows:

* `/`

  * Start at the homepage.

  * List all the available routes.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results from your precipitation analysis (i.e. retrieve only the last 12 months of data) to a dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.
* `/api/v1.0/tobs`

  * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most-active station for the previous year of data.

  * Return a JSON list of temperature observations for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the maximum temperature for a specified start or start-end range.

  * For a specified start, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all the dates greater than or equal to the start date.

  * For a specified start date and end date, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for the dates from the start date to the end date, inclusive.

### Hints
* Join the station and measurement tables for some of the queries.

* Use the Flask `jsonify` function to convert your API data to a valid JSON response object.
